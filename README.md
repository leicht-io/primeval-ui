# Primeval UI

Primeval UI is a small and minimalistic UI framework with minimal dependencies. The framework doesn't care about browser support since it is meant to work only in evergreen browsers.
It is meant to be lightweight and lightning fast without hundreds of components but only what's necessary. The CSS and JS is 20 KB in total when gzipped.

For now and in the nearest future this framework is solely in beta state.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://npm.com/) to install UI.

```bash
npm install @leicht.io/primeval-ui
```

## Running the demo application
Execute the following command to run the demo application: 
```bash
npm run development
```

## Usage

For now the library consists of the following components:
- Header Menu
- Photo Gallery
- Notifications
- Modals
- Loader 
- Inputs 
- Grids with Skeleton like Facebook e.g.
- Cards
- ReadingPositionIndicator
