  'title': 'BeoTac, a tachometer for the Beogram 4000 series',
  'content': '<p><em>This article aims at describing the process of developing and implementing an Arduino-based tachometer. This should make it possible to measure the performance and stability of the motor in a Beogram 4000 series turntable. The main concept of this system is a tachometer which uses interrupts to calculate the RPM of the turntable and sends the measurements to a connected PC via a serial interface.</em></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>It is crucial and of the utmost importance that the turntables I restore are stable, accurate and durable. Minor fluctuations in the stability of the RPM can seriously harm the user experience when listening to one’s favourite music and since the motors are over 40 years old this is often the case. <br/><br/>Therefore I needed a way to verify that the motors I restored were performing as expected over a longer period of time. I’ve found two possible solutions to this problem, namely the AR926 and <a href="https://beolover.blogspot.com/p/beoloverrpm-precise-rpm-measurements.html" target="_blank">BeoloverRPM </a>(from 2016) as seen in Figure 1.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-9a75bd68-5314-4391-9048-1b6652f3aac6.jpg"/><em>Figure 1: The AR926 compared to the BeoloverRPM</em><br/><br/>After multiple investigations, I ended up with the advantages and disadvantages of the existing solutions discussed below.<br/><br/><strong>Digital Tachometer, AR926</strong><br/><u>Advantages</u></p><ul><li>Battery driven.</li></ul><p><u>Disadvantages</u></p><ul><li>The mobile design doesn’t allow long-lasting test cases since you’ll need to hold it manually.</li><li>No serial interface.</li></ul><p><strong>BeoloverRPM</strong><br/><u>Advantages</u></p><ul><li>A fixed design and serial interface which allows us to do long-lasting test cases.</li></ul><p><u>Disadvantages</u></p><ul><li>Needs multiple parts if I want to use it with the turntable base mounted.</li><li>Design isn’t that streamlined.</li></ul><p><br/>With the previously mentioned advantages and disadvantages, I decided to develop my own implementation called BeoTac which enables me to do adequate performance and stability tests over a longer period of time since none of the solutions seems to solve my problem completely. My goal was to create an implementation a lot like Rudys but with the following improvements:<br/><br/><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Optimized design</strong></p><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The design should allow me to use BeoTac with the turntable base mounted or dismounted without using any extra 3D printed parts.</span></li></ul><p><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Extended software</strong></p><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The device should work on multiple devices and not just the Beogram 4000 series.</span></li></ul><h2><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Methods</span></h2><p>My initial idea was to create my own circuit with an IR-transmitter and receiver connected to an ATMega 328p microprocessor. I tried to measure the analogue values, but this proved inaccurate and difficult to control which is why I opted to use a digital circuit. To digitize the output from the IR emitter my idea was to include an OP-AMP comparator circuit (LM358).<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-2b403d55-6725-4026-ac84-a5ee0c947465.jpg"/><em>Figure 2: An early-stage prototype with the LM358.</em><br/><br/>After tinkering around with the circuit for some time I decided to simplify the process and decided to use an Arduino Nano in combination with an IR sensor module instead. <br/>This would make it easier for me to create an MVP as fast as possible and verify that the idea was possible. <br/>I 3D printed a minimal base, attached the IR sensor module and connected it to the Arduino Nano. The LED’s was bent downwards to pick up the black bars.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-ca881802-a7e9-46ff-b475-8a3b801f754e.jpg"/><em>Figure 3: An early-stage 3D printed part used to verify the idea.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-79021241-9c45-410a-8565-b7172bcec6ea.png"/><em>Figure 4: First readings when switching from 33RPM to 45RPM, using Arduinos Serial Plotter with a Baud Rate of 38400 Bd.</em><br/><br/>With a minimal codebase, the MVP verified that BeoTac solved my issues and made it possible for me to test the stability and performance of the motor. <br/>I designed the BeoTac casing from my blueprint to which the SSD1306 OLED display was later added. The sampling time was adjusted to one second since the Arduino would be exhausted by updating the screen and handle interrupts at the same time.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-eff3e9ea-15f2-4169-9e78-e9ce3d4ec020.jpg"/><em>Figure 5: Second iteration with the IR sensor attached.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-301ae13c-4737-4f74-8aef-455cb9504a05.jpg"/><em>Figure 6: Early prototype casing without the OLED screen attached.</em><br/><br/>The software was written from scratch and internally uses interrupts on PIN2 to increment a counter every time a black bar is registered by the IR receiver. Each second the RPM is calculated and sent to the PC via the serial connection and via I2C to the OLED screen.<br/><br/>The OLED screen shows the current RPM fixed with two decimals and a “checkmark” if the speed is ~33.33RPM or ~45RPM. Otherwise, it shows an “X” which could indicate that the motor is in need of restoration. <br/><br/>I also started using SerialPlot which enables me to take larger data samples, e.g. 24 hours, since Arduinos Serial Plot is limited to ~500 seconds. The screenshot below shows a sample of data for ~1 hour.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-04172c39-08d9-4def-a75a-ae2ad3c85c75.png"/><em>Figure 7: SerialPlot, plotting data for 1 hour.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-8d812847-54b9-4db9-8efb-2d9f1fc9b8dc.jpg"/><em>Figure 8: Prototyping requires a lot of testing.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-0304a38d-41fe-4010-9c4c-2e9a127814db.jpg"/><em>Figure 9: Testing the screen.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-bfb4693b-4694-43ac-9235-6c694ccbe9a5.jpg"/><em>Figure 10: Finished product compared to the early prototype.</em><br/><br/>The casing as seen in figure 11 worked as expected but after some field testing, I’ve addressed a couple of issues which improved the overall experience.<br/>Instead of using four screws to attach the bottom, I’ve changed the design to use a single screw which is indented such that the screws doesn’t scratch the base of the turntable.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-7f390ebe-7801-4d5d-98f7-cae21a1097bb.jpg"/><em>Figure 11: Optimized the bottom design and added a single indented screw to remove the risk of scratching the surface of the Beogram.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-ba38ecaa-25c8-4518-9bf4-c6d3e8fafb84.jpg"/><em>Figure 12: A 3D model which compares the two different bottom designs.</em><br/><br/>The base for the OLED screen was originally glued to the case but since glue an unsustainable solution I’ve updated the design and added screws instead. In this way, I am sure that the screen will never fall off.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-939ca776-4ac2-4a04-8d81-ab0cb3ff28e6.jpg"/><em>Figure 13: Second iteration of the finished model with screws attaching the screen instead of glue.</em><br/><br/>The software was also updated with a new feature enabling the use of the BeoTac on other turntables than the Beogram 4000 series. With a single command, it is possible to tell BeoTac how many bars it should react on. This makes it possible to print a white piece of paper with a single black bar on and add it to any type of turntable.<br/><br/>Below is a 3D image of my initial blueprint (right) and the finished model (left).<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-e776a137-5fc1-4992-8f30-b49f5f0d459f.jpg"/><em>Figure 14: First design prototype to the right, and the second iteration of the finished product to the left.</em><br/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-df3deb6c-a8b9-4ee7-9560-82ebac63c04a.jpg"/><em>Figure 15: 3 different prototypes compared next to each other.</em><br/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">For those interested the complete component list is below.</span><br/><strong>Hardware components</strong></p><ul><li>1 x Arduino Nano R3</li><li>1 x IR sensor module</li><li>1 x SSD1306 OLED Display</li><li>7 x 5cm wires</li></ul><p><strong>Software</strong><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent"> </strong></p><ul><li>Visual Studio Code with Platform IO</li><li>Fusion 360</li><li>Cura</li></ul><p><strong>Hand tools and fabrication machines</strong></p><ul><li>Soldering iron</li><li>Generic</li><li>Solder Wire, Lead-Free</li><li>Generic</li><li>3D Printer</li><li>Creality Ender 3</li><li>Material</li><li>PLA</li><li>Multimeter</li><li>Generic</li><li>Oscilloscope</li><li>Generic</li></ul><p><br/>Below you’ll find some images of the final product.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-b7a7be78-9331-401a-91c0-6eed2acde053.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-66d28d5f-7e7f-4249-9055-caf3c8c678c8.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="beotac-a-tachometer-for-the-beogram-4000-series-25c76789-2c99-48b6-b3e9-6e9a55e6c383.jpg"/><br/>Thanks for reading.

  'title': 'Restoring the keypad and chassis on a Beogram 4002 (BeoBooth v1)',
  'content': '<h2>Intro</h2><p><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">After replacing the light bulbs on the Beogram 4002 I wrote about in </span><a style="color:#000000" href="https://leicht.io/blog/replacing-the-incandescent-light-bulbs" target="_blank">my previous post</a><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent"> it was time to restore the keypad and chassis. </span><br/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">As almost always, the varnish and black paint are worn by decades of use since the acids in the skin dissolve it. As you can see from the image below this Beogram did also suffer from this issue. If this Beogram should be restored to perfection </span>it was crucial that the keypad was recoated and the chassis repainted.<br/>Furthermore, the contact springs and contact bridges underneath the contact pins were in need of a good old cleaning since the buttons didn&#x27;t always respond when being pressed. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-4f0e56c5-c088-4c02-af23-fe5dbbebed8e.jpg"/><br/>For the rest of this article I am going to refer to the official service manual for the Beogram 4002 from Bang &amp; Olufsen and use the terms described as seen in the image below.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-482d0292-00b2-4aa3-9296-a75ffd87bfad.jpg"/><br/>Therefore the complete unit is referred to as &quot;<strong>chassis (P&#x2F;N 3168049)</strong>&quot; and since the &quot;top aluminum plate&quot; is missing a term it will be referred to as &quot;<strong>keypad</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>buttons&quot;</strong>. If possible the term will be written with the associated part number (P&#x2F;N).</p><h2>The Problem</h2><p>Before restoring the chassis and recoating the keypad I needed to take the following issues into account:</p><ul><li><strong>Varnish;</strong> The new varnish should be at least as durable as the original.</li><li><strong>Dust;</strong> Dust should never be allowed to settle when recoating the keypad.  </li></ul><h2>The Solution</h2><p>With the problems in mind and after a lot of thoughts I decided to create my own paint booth making it possible to recoat the keypad. <br/>This article is meant as a step-by-step guide helping you restore your own chassis and is organized into chapters as seen below. <br/><br/><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The procedure for restoring the keypad is as follows:</strong></p><ol><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Remove the metal frame from the chassis.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Remove the old </span><span style="color:#000000">varnish </span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">and glue from the keypad.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Build your own ventilated paint booth (this takes some time).</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Paint the chassis and the keypad.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Clean all the contacts. </span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Assemble the chassis.</span></li></ol><p><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">This sounds easy, but let’s dig into it.</span></p><h2>The Process</h2><p><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Before we can recoat the keypad we need to remove the chassis from the actual keypad. If you’re lucky the keypad has already started to detach from the chassis since the glue is old and therefore adheres poorly. </span><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Otherwise, you’ll have to carefully press a spatula beneath the keypad in one of the corners. Make sure you don’t lift the keypad too much since this will cause it to bend which is irreversible. </span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-ce611569-e3d0-4eab-a4c5-83c5ef0af17a.jpg"/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">To remove the old varnish and glue on the back of the keypad I used a paint stripper called </span><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">NitroMors</strong><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">. It is very harsh so you need to do this outside or in a ventilated area.</span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-46d8d1e9-3f18-4459-964f-1d39c96ab115.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-144131a7-0259-4c3f-9172-c59d136ad66f.jpg"/><br/>After the old varnish was removed it was time to add a new layer of varnish. At this point in the process, I didn&#x27;t have any paint booth but I knew that dust specks were going to be an issue. Therefore, <span style="color:#000000">t</span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">o get the optimal results I decided to do the spray painting in multiple iterations writing down the pros and cons of each iteration. I cut 10 aluminium test sheets in the same dimensions as the frame and bought a cheap can of matte clear varnish. </span><br/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">To avoid dust specks I took an old unused bed roller, placed a test sheet inside and painted again. The results were acceptable but since the lid had to be off while painting dust specks would still settle in the paint. This was not acceptable. </span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-4295994e-f2fa-4c07-b0e0-a27c6701a554.jpg"/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Since dust was the main problem I decided to create a dedicated paint booth with filtered ventilation. Clean air = no dust, right?</span><br/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">After some brainstorming, and to make as cheap a prototype as possible, I decided to buy a secondhand TV stand from which I removed all the shelves. Since the stand is only accessible from the front my idea was that dust would not settle from above in the same way I did in the bed roller.</span><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">To make sure that even less dust would settle the lid from the bed roller was used as a &quot;door&quot; in the front of the booth. </span>Furthermore, to remove the initial dust from the air <span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">I installed an old PC fan which would pull air into the booth through a filter, resulting in much cleaner air. Below you will find an image of the BeoBooth v1 with short descriptions.</span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-9a564c68-7a08-40e7-900d-0efb6859e650.jpg"/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">After </span><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">BeoBooth v1 </strong><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">was assembled I painted another test frame. The results were even better than the results from the bed roller but some dust specks were still visible when looking very closely.</span><br/><br/>With all the problems above in mind, I decided to consult my local auto painter. He recommended me to use their 2K coat which consists of the varnish and a hardener. The 2K varnish should be just as durable as the original. He also recommended me to buy an air compressor and a paint gun so I could avoid wasting the varnish and use a smaller batch each time.<br/>The alternative was to use 2K spray cans but you have to release the hardener when you need to use it, after which the paint is only useful for 24 hours because it hardens. This would be expensive over time.<br/><br/>After setting everything up I painted another test frame and set it to dry. The results were almost perfect so I decided that I was ready to paint the actual keypad. The results were astonishing! The frame looked like it just left the factory. Decide for yourself but I am very satisfied!<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-fabf6d75-ce82-4978-989e-2aadbccd9b36.jpg"/><br/><span style="color:#000000">While the varnish was drying I </span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">painted the black parts of the chassis. They also get worn when using the keypad so of course, they needed to be repainted. </span><br/>I covered the chassis with masking tape and removed the old paint which isopropyl alcohol before painting it. I decided to paint it with a primer just to make it as durable as possible. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get a picture of the process only the result which you can see below.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-c5c36739-744c-4d31-9ecb-6e2007bfd154.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-18b05d5f-2dc9-4751-a57f-c0bae372b7c3.jpg"/><br/>Before assembling the chassis I removed the <strong>contact springs </strong>(P&#x2F;N 7500075)<strong> </strong>and <strong>contact bridges </strong>(P&#x2F;N 7500050) from the PCB (P&#x2F;N 8005018) and cleaned the contacts with ketchup which is <span style="color:#222222">acidic and therefore removes the oxidation as seen below. </span> The <strong>contact pin </strong>(P&#x2F;N 2992059)<strong> </strong>and <strong>holder </strong>(P&#x2F;N 3152068)<strong> </strong>were cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-b9209fb7-ae03-452b-8c2a-7a99166e6243.jpg"/><br/>After everything was cleaned and recoated I<span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent"> only needed to glue everything together. The plastic holder on the back of the chassis was glued with a normal superglue.</span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="recoating-the-keypad-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-6186c218-6fe6-462d-9ea5-db51957206c3.jpg"/><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Apparantly it took some time for me to find the correct glue for the keypad. The glue needed to have enough strength so the keypad wouldn&#x27;t fall off after a couple of years and it needed to have a low viscosity so the gap between the keypad and the chassis wouldn&#x27;t be to </span><span style="color:#222222">noticeable. </span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">I ended up with a 2K universal epoxy from Danalim which was recommended by another local hobbyist. It hardens over 6 hours which is a perfect time span for adjusting the frame after it is fixed.</span><br/><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">I used clamps and masking tape just to make sure that the glue wouldn’t accidentally end up on the black paint or other places on the chassis. </span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-3c964e8a-3d68-4228-bd91-24cbc8aed979.jpg"/><br/>To make sure that the keypad would stay in place while the epoxy was hardening i 3D printed a custom made lock which you can see in use below. This was made of PLA but still strong enough the press the keypad onto the chassis.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-c54f3869-625b-4413-96c9-a8b49da63614.jpg"/><br/>To make sure that the pressure wouldn&#x27;t cause any scratches onto the newly recoated surface I glued a  felt pad on the bottom of the custom printed plastic part.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-2e34632d-36b5-4947-8df5-74ec319f28b2.jpg"/><br/>After the expoxy was hardened i glued the plastic parts which touches the contact pins (I don&#x27;t have a name for these?) to the keypad using normal superglue. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-78e6c767-ca8d-43af-a4c0-00170acb6d77.jpg"/><br/>At last the main PCB was pushed in place and all the buttons were intensively tested to make sure that everything was assembled correctly. </p><h2>The Finished Product</h2><p>Voilá! As you can see below the results are very satisfying.  <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-3c24829d-bd1f-4eeb-b005-7c57d7e21cdd.jpg"/><br/>Now i only need to calibrate and test the Beogram to verify that everything is as expected. For this I&#x27;ll be using my almost-finished tachometer, which requires a completely new post to explain, so stay tuned!<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-the-keypad-and-chassis-on-a-beogram-4002-beobooth-v1-1d6973a5-e4d4-408f-a337-7ffc96c81bdb.jpg"/></p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The paint booth </span>I<span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent"> built was only meant to be a prototype. I&#x27;m currently working on the blueprints for </span><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">BeoBooth v2</strong><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent"> which is going to be way more advanced and imitate a professional painting environment with help from my auto painter.</span><br/><br/><strong style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">Below are some of the key differences which in theory, should make it possible to completely avoid dust. They will be a part of the next BeoBooth:</strong></p><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The booth should push the air out of the cabin in one end and pull it in from the other end resulting in better airflow. This could be done using a professional dust filter. This would also let the painted object dry faster since the air would not be saturated with fumes all the time.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000">The fume-saturated air from the booth should be directed outside instead of letting it accumulate in my workshop.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The dimensions of the booth should be increased. This would make it possible to also paint other parts of the Beogram. This would also make it possible to add holes and use laboratory gloves to handle the paint gun. Ideally, this would create a </span>hermetically closed booth <span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">where the air is only dragged in through the air filter.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000000;background-color:transparent">The booth should be heated. Heating the booth to around 70 degrees celsius allows the paint to dry in less than 30 minutes. This short timespan makes it very hard for a significant amount of dust to settle and creates a much better result.</span></li></ul><p>You are welcome to <a href="/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you have any inquiries or questions about this process.</p>',

  'title': 'Restoring a pair of Beovox MC120.2',
  'content': '<p>Last year I finally found a pair of Beovox MC120.2 which was going to replace my Beovox S55. Luckily the MC120.2 was in rosewood which matched my Beogram 4002 perfectly! Of course, the MC120.2 needed a restoration involving refoaming of the woofers and recapping the crossovers. I did this with my S55, so this was going to be a piece of cake.<br/><br/>Below you&#x27;ll find some photos of the MC120.2 before the restoration. Despite them being stored in a barn they were in somewhat good condition. As you&#x27;ll notice the wood was quite worn and the fabric also had paint on it. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-75c32923-11d0-4f45-9705-3f9a02015bd6.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-51603e75-6d14-4f04-a49c-5e4327d3a9bb.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-4513f23e-14d8-43fb-a9f9-c4cf6f0418df.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-91b457b4-6750-4f58-81c1-e015c23e1e09.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-00d14f97-a90f-4b50-ad90-54a7c73fba34.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-21d2b235-50e9-4cbd-86ad-b526177b9037.jpg"/><br/>I started by cleaning the cabinets and washing the fabric in soap and water. The paint was easily removable using rubbing alcohol.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-7c6b681e-b893-4f1e-bc40-4c0a5bdd40f5.jpg"/><br/>Voíla! That was much needed. Luckily the fabric was completely intact so no need to replace it as I did on my S55.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-7c4d9672-12ef-4fea-92b8-799466ec9edc.jpg"/><br/>After cleaning the cabinets I removed the interior before sanding them with grit 180. The interior was easily removed <span style="color:#314153">by removing the 6 cross-headed screws holding the front. </span>Since the top was scratched, I polished it with ring remover from Liberon before giving the cabinets a layer of danish oil. This removed all stains and scratches. At last the plastic fronts was cleaned with a <span style="color:#314153">Plastic Cleaner meant for car interior. This made them look dark and new.</span><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-b75cc135-78ae-4ea9-b80d-d8c8cce08aad.jpg"/><br/>As always, when the surrounds are made of foam and not rubber, they will rot as you can see on the images at the beginning of this post. I carefully removed the old surrounds with my fingers since it often tend to turn into a ball which is easy to remove. The remaning glue, as you can see below, was removed with a cotton swab and acetone. This process is a mess so make sure to do it somewhere that is easy to clean afterwards. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-1e9bf8fc-882b-401b-aa02-acaf6bbd481b.jpg"/><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-f1f7816c-62d5-4d0a-97d3-f20b19d467a2.jpg"/><br/>The new foam surrounds and glue was bought from <a style="background-color:#ffffff" href="https://audiofriends.eu/" target="_blank">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiofriends.eu&#x2F;</a>. I used waterbased glue for this purpose. Remember to make sure that the glue you are going to use becomes completely transparent when it dries.<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-bc2ec499-353d-49b6-bcf0-a5bf1f21a293.jpg"/><br/>After the glue had dried overnight i installed the woofers again. Looks good enough to me!<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-3b990d92-f93f-4edc-abca-e9cf006b7b57.jpg"/><br/>To make sure they would sound just like new I bought a new set of capacitors from Dillen. They were easily replaced. <br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-fc4b6f81-884e-44c5-9886-df3f6867c782.jpg"/><br/>After assembling each MC120.2 it was time for a soundcheck. I put them back on their stands and placed them accordingly to the Owners Manual from <strong>beomanuals.com.</strong><br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-b397e89f-784a-446d-aaf6-4909e339d949.jpg"/><br/>I was completely blown away by how they sound. They sounded breathtaking with an astonishing amount of details and clarity! I played a couple of albums on my BG5500 and heard new details in songs I have been listening to for years. No distortion at all, not even at high volumes. Of course, I need to listen to them for some hours before they are all set, but that should be no problem with a couple of good albums and a scotch whisky ;)<br/><img class="ql-image" src="restoring-a-pair-of-beovox-mc1202-fa066d0c-df0f-4bb5-858c-c8f471957f77.jpg"/></p>',
